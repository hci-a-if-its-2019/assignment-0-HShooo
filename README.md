<h2>The Problem with my </h2>
So, a few months ago I bought a powerbank and the first time i see it, i've already annoyed with the design. If you look in video, you can see that's it's just a black powebank, a flashlight and a lamp to let us know when we need to recharge the powebank. But, a thing i've annoyed been is we don't know how much like "it's still 20 percent or 50 percent" like that. So, i've always caution when the lamp is red - but i don't know how much. maybe it's still 35 percent or 20 percent that make it usable to charging in emergency way. When i search about the lamp in internet, i can't find about it.<br>
<h2> Solution </h2>
Maybe you can re-design it by using a parameter lamp like how much it is or AT LEAST give information about the lamp.
